          <p class="_body _line_height_1">This case study is a deep dive into a company’s decision to reach out to KPike Consulting Solutions, what their needs, desires and challenges were, and how KPike Consulting Solutions was able to deliver the results the client needed. 
          </p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">KPike Consulting Solutions specializes in Business Strategy & Innovation, working with start-up entrepreneurs & established companies seeking results.

          </p>
        <h2 class="lead-blue _header">RESEARCH</h2>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">This company was a newly established entity with two partners. There was a business plan, but it wasn’t finalized or significant enough to provide clear direction. There was little short-term and long-term action plans to hold the two partners accountable when introducing their business to the market. KPike Consulting Solutions built the client a website, helped the client establish their branding and created a pathway to stream clients to their services using online presence (SEO) and social media platforms using a proven market strategy. The company’s business plan was significantly cut down to provide focused direction and reduce ‘cloudiness’.

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="lead-blue _header">WHAT WE KNEW</h2>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">We knew that the two partners and newly established entity needed to finalize their business plan, create and agree upon a business identity and brand, and they didn’t need to spend too much time in the details. They needed to act.</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1" style="color: red;">Create. Test. Validate.</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">KPike Consulting Solutions practiced the notion that “the more you do, the more you’ll see. The more value you place, the more value you’ll get in return.” We had a lot to do in the 4 month timeframe that was discussed to get our client introduced to the market successfully. There was some back and forth but then we got moving swiftly. </p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">Our company understands that once you’re able to free up your time, your company becomes more valuable. Business partners and companies who are too busy fall short and end up doing an injustice to their company. You cannot place a value on deciding what’s best for your company, but you can do what’s best for your company. We know that CEO’s, Managers, and leaders of companies who are too busy are also very unproductive resulting in underperforming businesses and the inability to grow and innovate. 
          </p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">Once the company we were working with was able to identify they needed a business consultant, they understood the costs associated, and they were willing to take the necessary action to see results and achieve their goals. 
          </p>
        <h2 class="lead-blue _header">IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">▸<strong>The first action</strong> we took with our client was to help them define goals and benchmarks. Through our collaboration, we agreed on these three goals:</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">▸1. Successfully design & execute business plan</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">▸2. Successfully enter the market via applicable platform(s) for target audience</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">▸3. Increase profits for both cash flow and capital for future growth and research and development</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1"><strong>The second action</strong> we did for our client was to begin refining their business plan so that it not only caught the attention of investors, but that it was also created to hold two partners accountable for clear goals, responsibilities, objectives and outcomes. KPike Consulting Solutions created the business plan which outlined the three goals above in collaboration with the client</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1"><strong>The third action</strong> was to ‘take action.’ As a start-up there were many pivoting points and the two partners needed to be able to track and analyze these changes and growth points in order to know what was working and not working. We helped them set up a template to track their growth using our Go To Market Strategies. Monthly benchmarks were set at the start of each month. Data was collected at the end of the month regarding target audience outreach, lead generation & profits.</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1"><strong>The fourth action</strong> we took was to deploy a sustainable path to success by creating an operation efficiency strategy so that the two partners could sustain the start-up on the capital held currently and cash flow expected short-term and long-term. KPike Consulting Solutions guided them on all decisions, doing our best to make sure the client’s decisions were sound while leaving the final decisions up to the client.</p>
        <h2 class="lead-blue _header">THE GOAL</h2>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">The <strong>goal</strong> was to get this start-up and two partners on the path to success with experience and support they needed to stay confident in their pursuits and see immediate results.</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1" style="color: red;"><i>“Honestly we were not expecting to reach our goals and ROI so quickly, but Kassie kept our sights high and made sure we stayed on course on literally everything that we needed.”</i></p>

        <h2 class="lead-blue _header">RESULTS</h2>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">▸  The company explained in this case study is now approaching their 1 year anniversary. When 90% of start-ups fail in their first year; this is a big call for celebration. Through the services provided by KPike Consulting Solutions the company was able to <strong>exceed their cash flow expectations in the first year</strong> by employing an ‘A’ Team using our operational efficiency strategy, and practice good partnership responsibilities using the refined business partner responsibilities in the clear business plan</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">▸  With KPike Consulting Solutions setting great importance on goal setting and benchmarking, the two partners were able to effectively create, test, and validate actions taken and decisions made within their company in the first year and are well underway to success in their second year.</p>
          <p class="_body _line_height_1">▸  As the company continues on the path to success we continue to provide our services and act as a resource, because to us your not just a client; you’re a long-term business relationship. The return on investment is seen in both the eyes of our company and the client as a win-win.</p>
